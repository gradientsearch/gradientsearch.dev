						Throughout my career, I have developed a strong skill set in software development,
						cybersecurity, site reliability engineering, and machine learning, having successfully
						addressed business challenges across various stages of the product development
						lifecycle. As an avid learner, I stay adaptable to the ever-evolving technology
						landscape, and I am passionate about the innovation and opportunities the tech industry
						offers. I have had the privilege of working for such companies as Equinix, Global
						Payments, and Georgia Tech Research Institute.

						Whether I'm writing code in Go, scripting in Python, configuring CI/CD workflows, or
						developing Kubernetes manifests, I focus on ensuring clarity, correctness, and
						efficiency to optimize product maintenance. I follow Kent Beckâ€™s design principles,
						which emphasize: 1) Passing tests, 2) Revealing intention, 3) Avoiding duplication, and
						4) Using the fewest elements. Having worked on numerous legacy systems, I am
						particularly mindful of the importance of future-proofing solutions with an eye toward
						maintaining code quality and professional courtesy for future developers.

					<PageSubtitle>
						Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and recreational
						sports. Indoors, I spend my time reading, experimenting with bread baking, and exploring
						various tech interests, including Arduino microcontrollers, security-focused Android
						distributions (such as LineageOS and CalyxOS), SELinux, container security, and diving
						into the world of 3D printing.
