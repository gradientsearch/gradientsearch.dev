							"▼ Re-architected the software to support any Linux distro by abstracting how it monitors systemd and audit logs, creating a mental model for ingesters and processors, while eliminating approximately 1,000 lines of complex code.",
							"▼ Further abstracted and simplified ingesters through the use of named pipes, providing a simple interface for ingesters to consume new events. Used the <strong>bufio.ReadString</strong> method, which blocks until a delimiter is matched or an error is returned, often <strong>io.EOF</strong> when the named pipe closes.",
